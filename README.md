For code review of Acorn Analytics 

There are 3 files:

1. PCA.ipynb

Jupyter notebook to do Principle Component Analysis from scratch. It reads NMIST hand digitwriting data (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of digit "2" and "4", and reduces the dimension from 784 to 2 principle components. From there histogram and Bayesian classifiers are applied and classification accuracy are calculated.

Showcases my understanding of general Python, and Numpy/matplotlib libraries. 

2. Data_Cleaning.ipynb

Jupyter notebook to read and clean the Airbnb data of San Francisco scraped by http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.

Showcases my understanding of pandas library.

3. peakmonth.m

One of matlab files for my research paper (pubished at: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2013JG002382). 

Showcases general coding, and knowledge for various data formats for data storage (e.g., netcdf).
